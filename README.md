# VTop-Captcha-Solver
This is an extention to autofill captcha on VIT Bhopal's vtop login. I made with the help of ChatGPT to test its power. This Extension Uses a Javascript version of OpenCV and Tesract OCR to clean the captcha and perform an OCR.

How To Use:
1. Download the zip file and unpack.
2. Go to chrome://extensions/ and turn on Developer mode by clicking on the slider in the top right hand corner

4. Navigate to the folder with all the unpacked source files.
5. Click on "Select Folder" and the extension will automatically activate.
6. Go to https://vtop.vitbhopal.ac.in/vtop/initialProcess and the extension will work.

Note: The Captcha solver isnt 100% accurate. You can click on the Catcha refresh button to generate a new captca that the captca solver will solve.
